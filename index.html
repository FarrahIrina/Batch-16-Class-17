                Well lets just stir things up right away. Almonds are not a type of nut. They are the seed of a fruit that comes from almond trees. They are a stone fruit (like a cherry, plum, or peach). They all have a fleshy fruit surrounding a pit on the inside. For culinary purposes, however, most people consider almonds nuts.</div>

            <div class="bg-info col-6">Almond Taste: Almonds have a natural sweetness that is often described as mild and subtle. This sweetness is one of the reasons why they are a common ingredient in desserts, snacks, and baked goods. They also have a rich, nutty flavor that is more pronounced when they are roasted or toasted. This nuttiness makes them a popular choice for almond butter and almond-flavored products.Almond Aroma: The aroma of almonds is another important aspect of their taste experience. While their aroma is not overpowering, they have a fragrant, nutty scent that can be quite enticing, whether you’re eating them plain or using them in cooking.
